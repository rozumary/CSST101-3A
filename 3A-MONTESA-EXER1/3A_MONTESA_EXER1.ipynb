        "Expert systems use propositional logic and predicate logic:\n",
        "\n",
        " **Propositional logic** represents simple facts and rules using AND, OR, NOT. For example: \"If raining AND cold, THEN risk of ice.\"\n",
        "\n",
        " **Predicate logic** represents complex relationships. For example: \"All birds can fly.\" Uses predicates like \"is a bird\" and quantifiers like \"all\".\n",
        "\n",
        "The inference engine applies logical rules to the knowledge base to derive new facts. Two common methods are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Forward chaining**: Start with known facts, apply rules to infer new facts until a conclusion. Good for prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Backward chaining**: Start with a hypothesis, work backwards to find supporting facts. Good for diagnosis.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Advantages*\n",
        "\n",
        " **Transparency**: The rules are explicit and human-readable, so the reasoning is explainable.\n",
        "\n",
        " **Flexibility**: Can handle incomplete info using fuzzy logic. Knowledge base can be updated.\n",
        "\n",
        " **Reusability**: Knowledge base and inference engine can be reused across applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Challenges*\n",
        "\n",
        " **Knowledge acquisition**: Populating the knowledge base is difficult and time-consuming.\n",

        " **Scalability**: Inference can be computationally expensive as knowledge grows.\n",
        "\n",
        " **Brittleness**: Can't handle situations outside predefined rules. Invalid inputs produce nonsense.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Case Study: MYCIN*\n",
