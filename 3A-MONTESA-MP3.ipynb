        "Task:\n",
        "Here, I wrote a functon to simulate a decision-making process with uncertain outcomes, specifically for investment decisions. This function models potential outcomes using a probability distribution.\n",

        "- Reward for success\n",
        "- Penalty for failure\n",
        "\n",
        "The simulation runs for a specified number of trials, calculating the average return and allowing users to see how changing probabilities affect the outcome. This task highlighted the importance of decision-making.\n",

        "\n",
        "Task:\n",
        "I used Python to generate and visualize binomial and normal probability distributions relevant to scenarios like coin flips or dice rolls.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interactive Component:\n",
        "Users can select to simulate either a binomial or normal distribution. The program generates the chosen distribution and displays a histogram using matplotlib. This visualization helped solidify how different distributions behave.\n",

        "\n",
        "Task:\n",
        "I created a Python script to predict the probability of rain based on factors like humidity and cloud cover using conditional probability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interactive Component:\n",
        "The program prompts users for:\n",
        "- Humidity level (high, medium, low)\n",
        "- Cloud cover (heavy, medium, light)\n",
        "\n",
        "It calculates the probability of rain based on these inputs and provides feedback on the likelihood of rain, reinforcing the practical applications of probability theory in everyday life.\n",
        "\n",
        "To conclude, this machine problem was a valuable learning experience. It enhanced my understanding of probability theory and its applications in AI. The interactive components made complex concepts more accessible, allowing me to see firsthand how probabilities influence decision-making in reality."
