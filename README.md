[3A-MONTESA-MP3](https://github.com/rozumary/CSST101-3A/tree/main/3A-MONTESA-MP3)

Objective:
In this machine problem, you will apply probability theory, Bayesian inference, and decision-making under uncertainty to real-world scenarios using Python. The goal is to create an interactive Python program that allows you to simulate and visualize probabilistic reasoning in various AI contexts.

**Machine Problem 4: Bayesian Network for Healthcare Diagnosis**

[3A-MONTESA-MP4](https://github.com/rozumary/CSST101-3A/tree/main/3A-MONTESA-MP4)

**Overview:**
In this task, you will develop a Bayesian Network model to diagnose a common health condition using Python and the pgmpy library. The goal is to understand how probabilistic reasoning can aid in medical diagnosis by creating a network that models relationships between symptoms, conditions, and diagnostic results.

**Healthcare Scenario:**
Consider a diagnostic model for a condition like heart disease. The Bayesian Network will include various risk factors and symptoms. Your network will use these factors to infer the likelihood of heart disease in a patient.
