"""**Explanations**

1. Function Definitions:
   - **and_operation**, **or_operation**, **not_operation**, and **implies_operation** are standard propositional logic operations.
   - ***evaluate*** evaluates logical statements by replacing propositions with their truth values.
   - **forall** and **exists** handle predicate logic for a range of values.

2. Book Recommendation System (as an example):
   - The **recommend_book** function uses propositional logic to decide on book recommendations based on user preferences and mood.
   - It also checks if the user likes thrillers and is excited, then recommends a thriller.
   - It suggests a romance book if the user likes romance and isn't feeling sad.
   - It also checks if the user likes mysteries using predicate logic and suggests a book if true.
   - If none of these conditions are met, it provides a general recommendation as a whole.
